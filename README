This is a fork of the original JSLint by Douglas Crockford

The objective of this fork is to add some options that i need.
For example:

- Option to allow multiline strings without the need for backslashes or concatenation;
- Option to deactivate the obligatory presence of "use strict" in functions;
- Add some global objects and functions without the need to add them on the top of every script;

The motivation for this fork is to use it in a huge legacy project that use a  JS dialect that support the things above.
